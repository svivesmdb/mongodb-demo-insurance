# Insurance Single View Service on MongoDB

## Overview
This Python Flask application provides a RESTful service interface to access the insurance single view based on MongoDB.

## Test
In order to test locally, ```docker-compose.yml``` provides the parameter for accessing MongoDB as well as the ports on which the application should be accessible.

Start the local application with:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

After the successfull startup, the application can be accessed via your web browser on port 4000:
```
# List of all customers (paginated with 100 customers):
http://localhost:4000/customer
http://localhost:4000/customer?page=2
http://localhost:4000/customer?page=3

# All parameters, except 'page' are transformed into a query.
# Get customer with particular ID:
http://localhost:4000/customer?customer_id=C000038970
# Get customer with a particular home insurance policy:
http://localhost:4000/customer?home_insurance.policy_id=P000003753
```

## Build
Create a docker image from the sources:
```
docker build -t ckurze/insurance-service .
```

Optionally, push into the docker repository:
```
docker login

docker push ckurze/insurance-service
```

## Run the Service

After building the docker image, it can be run with:
```
docker run \
-p 4000:4000 \
-e ENV=development \
-e PORT=4000 \
-e DB=mongodb://host.docker.internal:27017/insurance \
--name mdb-insurance-serivce \
-t ckurze/insurance-service
```


## Deploy to Kubernetes Cluster

This example uses a minishift installation, should also work on minikube and other Kubernetes implementations.

```
# Login to minishift
oc login -u system

# Create a new namespace 'insurance':
# (Alternative kubectl create namespace insurance)
oc new-project insurance

# Apply the deployment and service.
# The service will be available at http://192.168.99.100:30001/ (depending on your Kubernetes cluster IP).
kubectl apply -f packaging/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f packaging/service.yaml
```
